   │                    Ambiguous usage of variable 'flips'
   │                    Try an explicit annotation, e.g. 'move flips' or 'copy flips'

   = Ambiguous inference of 'move' or 'copy' for a borrowed variable's last usage: A 'move' would invalidate the borrowing reference, but a 'copy' might not be the expected implicit behavior since this the last direct usage of the variable.
