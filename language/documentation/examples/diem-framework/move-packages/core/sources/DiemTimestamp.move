/// This module keeps a global wall clock that stores the current Unix time in microseconds.

/// * Genesis: to initialize the timestamp
/// * VASP: to keep track of when credentials expire
/// * DiemSystem, DiemAccount, DiemConfig: to check if the current state is in the genesis state
/// * DiemBlock: to reach consensus on the global wall clock time
/// * AccountLimits: to limit the time of account limits
