Command `build -v --arch ethereum`:
Error: Unresolved addresses found: [
Named address 'A' in package 'A'
]
To fix this, add an entry for each unresolved address to the [addresses] section of ./Move.toml: e.g.,
[addresses]
Std = "0x1"
Alternatively, you can also define [dev-addresses] and call with the --dev flag
